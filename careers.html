		"Recent college graduates and grizzled veterans benefit from obtaining professional accreditations (aka Certs). Certs are a pre-requisite or a preferred qualification for most job openings as they afford recruiters a differentiator among candidates; i.e. more likely to warrant an interview.  Certs demonstrate a candidate’s effort to stay current with emerging trends/best practices in their field. Certs demonstrate an employee’s commitment to continuous learning by taking the initiative to enhance their skillset.  This maintains an employee’s marketability as Certs are often what recruiters search for to find qualified candidates. Name an industry and there are Certs only a true Subject Matter Expert (SME) can obtain as there are degrees of SMEness for all disciplines/roles.  Certs are available for virtually all disciplines/roles with progressive work experience prerequisites."

		"A cert is only as good as the information it contains: in IT, many of us are blessed to be standing on the shoulders of giants... which is to say, we're not the first person trying to do $thing.  As such, for IT, certs have two primary purposes: to overcome HR hurdles, or to provide you with a set of relevant information that you don't want to take the time to hunt down yourself.  To the first point, some job positions will look favorably (or even require) certifications: CompTIA and Cisco tend to be the two ones I see in job postings.  For those, folks looking to get into those roles just need to bite the bullet: it doesn't matter if you already know the information that the cert will provide, you need that cert in order to get the interview.  To the second point, we all rely on Google to help guide us toward some post on StackOverflow et. al. that will help us solve whatever problem we're working on; one of the coolest aspects of working in IT, in my opinion, is that the information on how to do $thing is almost always freely available... one just has to go looking for it.  Said differently: why would I pay for a collection of information that I can freely acquire on my own time?"</p>

        A cert is only as good as the information it contains: in IT, many of us are blessed to be standing on the shoulders of giants... which is to say, we're not the first person trying to do $thing.

        Which brings us to the third question: what certs I might suggest someone obtain.  The value that any given cert has to a company is something that's going to be industry-dependent.  For example, the security field looks quite favorably upon SANS certifications, but these certifications cost almost a whopping $8k when you include the training materials.  Obviously this isn't something you're going to see as a requirement on entry-level positions due to the price barrier - so what about other security certs?  Security+ and Cloud+ from CompTIA are both reasonably priced such that one could afford them out of pocket, but does $company care that you have them?  There's no way to know without examining the job postings for a given company and seeing what they're looking for - the knowledge that is contained in a cert is, above all else, what someone should be looking to acquire as opposed to a cert itself.  The exception to this is when the cert is an HR hurdle - if HR tells you to jump, all you can do is jump.

		"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

<!-- Chelsey's tickets for careers page / questions for Trey
     - how can we make the overlays stretch when people zoom out (I FIXED THIS WITH THE HomeImage class - Chelsey)
     	- next to the graph can the arrow not be so close (when i add the link the space is good but the image is too small) **NEVERMIND I FIXED IT
     - the learn more tab is way too long and the link to the forbes sight does not work
