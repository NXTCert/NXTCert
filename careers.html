			"Recent college graduates and grizzled veterans benefit from obtaining professional accreditations (aka Certs). Certs are a pre-requisite or a preferred qualification for most job openings as they afford recruiters a differentiator among candidates; i.e. more likely to warrant an interview.  Certs demonstrate a candidate’s effort to stay current with emerging trends/best practices in their field. Certs demonstrate an employee’s commitment to continuous learning by taking the initiative to enhance their skillset.  This maintains an employee’s marketability as Certs are often what recruiters search for to find qualified candidates. Name an industry and there are Certs only a true Subject Matter Expert (SME) can obtain as there are degrees of SMEness for all disciplines/roles.  Certs are available for virtually all disciplines/roles with progressive work experience prerequisites."

		"A cert is only as good as the information it contains: in IT, many of us are blessed to be standing on the shoulders of giants... which is to say, we're not the first person trying to do something.  As such, for IT, certs have two primary purposes: to overcome HR hurdles, or to provide you with a set of relevant information that you don't want to take the time to hunt down yourself.  To the first point, some job positions will look favorably (or even require) certifications: CompTIA and Cisco tend to be the two ones I see in job postings.  For those, folks looking to get into those roles just need to bite the bullet: it doesn't matter if you already know the information that the cert will provide, you need that cert in order to get the interview.  To the second point, we all rely on Google to help guide us toward some post on StackOverflow et. al. that will help us solve whatever problem we're working on; one of the coolest aspects of working in IT, in my opinion, is that the information on how to do $thing is almost always freely available... one just has to go looking for it.  Said differently: why would I pay for a collection of information that I can freely acquire on my own time?"</p>

				"Many people apply for jobs that provide opportunity for growth, which means they may not have all the skills required at the time of hire. Preparing for and earning certifications are a great way to ramp up your skills and move up more quickly. Taking classes, reading study guides and completing online training modules can help you gain the skills you need in small chunks. You can immediately take what you learn and implement it on the job, and when you’re ready, you can take the certification exam to validate your newfound knowledge."

<!-- Chelsey's tickets for careers page / questions for Trey
     - how can we make the overlays stretch when people zoom out (I FIXED THIS WITH THE HomeImage class - Chelsey)
     	- next to the graph can the arrow not be so close (when i add the link the space is good but the image is too small) **NEVERMIND I FIXED IT
     - the learn more tab is way too long and the link to the forbes sight does not work
