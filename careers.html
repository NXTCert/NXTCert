		"Recent college graduates and grizzled veterans benefit from obtaining professional accreditations (aka Certs). Certs are a pre-requisite or a preferred qualification for most job openings as they afford recruiters a differentiator among candidates; i.e. more likely to warrant an interview.  Certs demonstrate a candidate’s effort to stay current with emerging trends/best practices in their field. Certs demonstrate an employee’s commitment to continuous learning by taking the initiative to enhance their skillset.  This maintains an employee’s marketability as Certs are often what recruiters search for to find qualified candidates. Name an industry and there are Certs only a true Subject Matter Expert (SME) can obtain as there are degrees of SMEness for all disciplines/roles.  Certs are available for virtually all disciplines/roles with progressive work experience prerequisites."

<!-- Chelsey's tickets for careers page / questions for Trey
     - how can we make the overlays stretch when people zoom out (I FIXED THIS WITH THE HomeImage class - Chelsey)
     	- next to the graph can the arrow not be so close (when i add the link the space is good but the image is too small) **NEVERMIND I FIXED IT
     - the learn more tab is way too long and the link to the forbes sight does not work
